# 4 to 12 Demultiplexer:

## About the project:
- Inputs: `D` the data in, `S` the 4-bits select lines and `Ebar` the active-low enable input.
- Outputs: `Y` 12-bits bus.
- It uses 3 of 2-to-4 demultiplexers to make a full 4-to-12 demultiplexer.

## What did I learn from it:
- Using components in VHDL to build bigger systems.
- Using `map` function.
